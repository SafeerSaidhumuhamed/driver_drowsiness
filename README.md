This project focuses on developing a real-time Driver Drowsiness Detection System to enhance road safety by monitoring and analyzing drivers' behavioral characteristics. The system utilizes a dataset of 7000 facial expressions to identify signs of drowsiness, such as eye closure, yawning, and head nodding.

Key Features:

Data Collection: Compiled and preprocessed a comprehensive dataset of 7000 facial expressions, capturing various drowsiness indicators.

Feature Extraction: Identified and extracted relevant features like eye blink rate, mouth openness, and head position to assess driver alertness.

Machine Learning: Implemented Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify drowsy versus alert states with high accuracy.

Real-Time Monitoring: Integrated the trained model into a real-time system that analyzes live video feeds from a camera installed in the vehicle.

Performance Optimization: Enhanced system performance by reducing latency and improving processing speed for timely drowsiness alerts.

Testing and Validation: Conducted extensive testing in various driving conditions to ensure reliability and accuracy of the detection system.

The project demonstrates the application of machine learning and computer vision techniques to address a critical issue in road safety, providing a practical solution to prevent accidents caused by driver fatigue.
